# Odyssey-of-the-Dragonlords-GGMM-Creatures
A collection of creatures made for the D&amp;D 5e adventure Odyssey of the Dragonlords, using GiffyGlyph's Monster Maker.

## Using GiffyGlyph's Monster Maker

GiffyGlyph's Monster Maker is a set of rules for creating creatures in 5e that are meant to present a wider array of combat options and more engaging boss fights. The most recent version of this ruleset as of this writing can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTdevsM641DQRA2sI1f6w1aPpFmlLIiM/view. I strongly recommend reading over this before using any of the creatures presented here, since most or all of them use mechanics that are unique to this module (which I will be referring to from here onwards as "GGMM"). You can easily create your own creatures using the GGMM app here: http://www.giffyglyph.com/monstermaker/app/

## Downloading and Reading the Files

The files in this repo are .json files. What this means is that you can download the file, go to the GGMM app linked above, navigate to the Vault tab, and click on the gear in the bottom-right corner. From the menu that appears, select "Import Monsters from .json", and upload the file. You should then have a copy of the monster's stat block, available for you to view and edit.

This readme file also contains my commentary on some of these creatures, and I recommend reading this before running these creatures in your own adventures.
